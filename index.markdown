Welcome to my blog! I'm a Information Security student at the Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade do Porto, Portugal. I'm currently working on a project that involves Rust, gRPC, and CTF challenges. I'm interested in blockchain, distributed systems, cloud computing, networking, and systems programming. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/rootHytx).

`hytx` (pronounced "heights"):

* Bachelor's in Computer Science (2019-2023)
* Master's in Information Security (2023-Ongoing)

My projects:

* [Embedded Systems Rust gRPC server for controlling a smart gate](https://github.com/rootHytx/sistemas-embutidos).
* [Blockchain implemented in Rust for Systems and Data Security class](https://github.com/rootHytx/bloccChainz).
* [Communcations Network project in Java](https://github.com/rootHytx/trabalho-redes).
